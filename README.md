# La MAMMA Pizza

La Mamma is an online fast food delivery B2C store, inspired by Italian cuisine, specializing in pizzas and pasta. It was built using the Django and Bootstrap frameworks.
The project was conceived entirely as an original creation, with no replication of the Boutique Ado project.

Italian cuisine, along with its colors, themes, and decorations, served as the sole inspiration for the entire design.

Authenticated users can browse through the menu, explore the flavors of pizzas, ingredients, sizes, and prices.

The project was designed to convey to the user the experience of an authentic Italian pizzeria, with carefully selected ingredients and unique flavors, making La Mamma the best pizzeria in town.

## Agile Aproach

This project was designed and built using the agile approach. To visualize the different elements of the project, I created a GitHub project and used the provided [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/RubemJanoni/projects/7) to track the progress of my work. Project elements are assigned to different User Stories that can be opened to view Acceptance Criteria and Tasks to be completed. Additionally, each user story was labeled to indicate the priority and importance of the respective features for the overall functioning and functionality of the site
