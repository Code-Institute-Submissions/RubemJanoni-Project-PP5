# La MAMMA Pizza

La Mamma is an online fast food delivery B2C store, inspired by Italian cuisine, specializing in pizzas and pasta. It was built using the Django and Bootstrap frameworks.
The project was conceived entirely as an original creation, with no replication of the Boutique Ado project.

Italian cuisine, along with its colors, themes, and decorations, served as the sole inspiration for the entire design.

Authenticated users can browse through the menu, explore the flavors of pizzas, ingredients, sizes, and prices.

The project was designed to convey to the user the experience of an authentic Italian pizzeria, with carefully selected ingredients and unique flavors, making La Mamma the best pizzeria in town.

# Agile Aproach

This project was designed and built using the agile approach. To visualize the different elements of the project, I created a GitHub project and used the provided [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/RubemJanoni/projects/7) to track the progress of my work. Project elements are assigned to different User Stories that can be opened to view Acceptance Criteria and Tasks to be completed. Additionally, each user story was labeled to indicate the priority and importance of the respective features for the overall functioning and functionality of the site

# Design

The design of our website reflects the authenticity and charm of Italian cuisine. With a color palette inspired by the vibrant Italian flag, we highlight green, white, and red, creating a warm and familiar atmosphere from the first glance.

Our goal is to provide a visual experience that transports our customers directly to an authentic Italian pizzeria, where every detail is carefully selected to reflect the tradition and quality of our dishes.

Simplicity and elegance are key features of the design, ensuring intuitive navigation and a pleasant experience for users. Menus are organized clearly and concisely, making it easy to view our dishes and delivery options.

In summary, the design of our website pays homage to the rich culinary tradition of Italy, capturing the essence of the country and conveying it to our customers in a captivating and inspiring way.

## Database structure

To illustrate my database structure, I used Vision to create an ERD-diagram

For this project, Object-Oriented Programming princiciples and Django's class-based generic views were applied. For the User authentication system, the Allauth library was used. Alongside the models presented in the E-Commerce walkthrough (User, ProfileUser, Product, Order, OrderItem).
