# La MAMMA Pizza

La Mamma is an online fast food delivery B2C store, inspired by Italian cuisine, specializing in pizzas and pasta. It was built using the Django and Bootstrap frameworks.
The project was conceived entirely as an original creation, with no replication of the Boutique Ado project.

Italian cuisine, along with its colors, themes, and decorations, served as the sole inspiration for the entire design.

Authenticated users can browse through the menu, explore the flavors of pizzas, ingredients, sizes, and prices.

The project was designed to convey to the user the experience of an authentic Italian pizzeria, with carefully selected ingredients and unique flavors, making La Mamma the best pizzeria in town.

# Agile Aproach

This project was designed and built using the agile approach. To visualize the different elements of the project, I created a GitHub project and used the provided [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/RubemJanoni/projects/7) to track the progress of my work. Project elements are assigned to different User Stories that can be opened to view Acceptance Criteria and Tasks to be completed. Additionally, each user story was labeled to indicate the priority and importance of the respective features for the overall functioning and functionality of the site

# User Experience

### Target Audience

The target audience consists of pizza enthusiasts who appreciate high-quality ingredients and seek the authentic Italian taste delivered to their doorstep

### Owner's Goal

The website owner's objective is to promote their products online, connect with their customers, and offer their delivery service.

### Customer's Goal

The customers' goal is to conveniently browse and order their favorite pizzas online and have them delivered to their doorstep.

### Business Model

The business model is B2C (Business to Customer) which means that the business sells to private customers only.

### Marketing Strategies

For this project several Marketing strategies were used which are SEO, Content Marketing, Social Media Marketing and Email Marketing.

### Seo

- **Keywords**

For the search of suitable keywords for my website I initially used wordtracker.com. Since the free trial only allowed two searches, I used Google search results as primary way of finding suitable keywords. To check the popularity of certain Short-tail and Long-tail keywords, I also checked the 'Related Searches' and 'People also ask' sections on Google. In my search for keywords I aimed at coming up with keywords that have high volume aswell as low competition. I came up with this list of relevant keywords that are most suitable for improving the site's ranking in search engine results, ranking the keywords by the number of search results:

- authentic italian dough
- Pizza Artisan
- Pizza
- Food delivery
- Pizza Delivery
- Delivery
- Pizza near me
- Fast food

These keywords are listed in the Meta block of the head section in the base.html to improve the SEO.


### Social Media Marketing

For a social media marketing approach, a Facebook Business Page has been created, that represents the business. As the Facebook profile image, an authentic Italian pizza coming out of the oven was used. Also, in this project and on the Facebook profile, images of the Mario Bros character generated in AI were used.

### Email Marketing

Visitors of the website can find a newsletter signup form in the about page where they can fill in their email without any further registration to receive a potential newsletter via email that provides information about sales and new products of the website. The newsletter is handled by MailChimp. For the time being, visitors can enter their email address to signup.

### Favicon

To further enhance the branding, a favicon featuring the Italian flag, representing the company's logo, has been implemented on the website, highlighting its origin in Italian cuisine.

### Robots.txt / Sitemaps.xml

To further enhance the website's SEO ranking, a robots.txt and a sitemap.xml file have been created. The robots.txt file informs search engines to avoid certain areas of the website. The sitemap.xml file was created using the xml-sitemaps.com website to provide a comprehensible understanding of the website's structure to search engines. By having a sitemap.xml file, search engines will crawl every important page on the website which enhances indexing.

# Design

The design of our website reflects the authenticity and charm of Italian cuisine. With a color palette inspired by the vibrant Italian flag, we highlight green, white, and red, creating a warm and familiar atmosphere from the first glance.

Our goal is to provide a visual experience that transports our customers directly to an authentic Italian pizzeria, where every detail is carefully selected to reflect the tradition and quality of our dishes.

Simplicity and elegance are key features of the design, ensuring intuitive navigation and a pleasant experience for users. Menus are organized clearly and concisely, making it easy to view our dishes and delivery options.

In summary, the design of our website pays homage to the rich culinary tradition of Italy, capturing the essence of the country and conveying it to our customers in a captivating and inspiring way.

## Database structure

To illustrate my database structure, I used Vision to create an ERD-diagram

For this project, Object-Oriented Programming princiciples and Django's class-based generic views were applied. For the User authentication system, the Allauth library was used. Alongside the models presented in the E-Commerce walkthrough (User, ProfileUser, Product, Order, OrderItem).
